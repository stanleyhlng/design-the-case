Smart Phones, Smart Fun - Design the Case Competition

### The Competition

It is a design competition to design a phone case for the Apple iPhone and the Android phone.  The goal of this challenge is to "personalize" your phone case, makes it unique for everyone in Yahoo.

### Design Concept

In my design, people can customize the following elements in their phone case:

#### 1. `Avatar`

In `avatar` region, you can pick `your`/`founder`/`ceo`/`anonymous` photo, or `property`/`team` icon (e.g. `flickr`, `news`, ...).

#### 2. `Name & Years of Services`

In `name & years of services` region, you can put your `name`, `job title` and `years of services`.

In `remark` region, you can select your `personal signature`, `mobile phone no.`, or `social network id`.
